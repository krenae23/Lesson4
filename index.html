          class="center">
          <p> NC3ADL was in need of a logo and backdrop for their "Distance Learning: New Wave" conference. The conference is 100% online. Therefore, they reached out to create a design. I designed a logo that they liked and it will be presented during the conference in the background.</p>

          <p> I designed a poster for the North Carolina Zoo. The poster was for their Spring event. I wanted the giraffe to look like it was popping in to say "Come hang with us!"</p>

          <img src="file:///Users/kaelahendley/Desktop/ResumeAssignment/%20images/ARSONVINYL.jpg" alt="Vinyl Design" class="center">>
          <p> j-hope from BTS released a song called "Arson" from his debut album "Jack in the Box". I wanted the design to really emphasize the whole fire concept. I decided to make the word "Arson" look as if it were melting. </p>
